# Master Web Architecture & Security Workflow

Execute this workflow securely. Enforce mandatory baseline rules on EVERY project, then apply contextual modules based on the evaluation of `00-project-idea.md`.

## Stage 1: Mandatory Core Baseline (Always Enforced)

Apply these baseline controls across all code, regardless of application scale:

### 1. Input Handling & Data Protection

- Enforce strict server-side validation and sanitization on all incoming payloads using schema validators. Never trust client-side validation alone.
- Protect against injection vectors (SQLi, NoSQLi, XSS, Command Injection).
- Sanitize HTML outputs in frontend views using sanitizers like DOMPurify.

### 2. Cryptography & Secret Hygiene

- Never commit credentials, secrets, or API keys to version control.
- Enforce isolated environment configurations (`.env`) per deployment stage.
- Hash all passwords using modern, adaptive algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).
- Enforce secure communications over HTTPS only and enable HSTS headers.

### 3. Session & Token Hardening

- Store access/session tokens exclusively in secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
- Avoid storing sensitive JWTs or session identifiers in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
- Enforce token expiration with short lifespans and implement revocable refresh tokens.

### 4. Server & Transport Hardening

- Inject standard security headers using middleware (e.g., Helmet): `CSP`, `X-Frame-Options`.
- Configure restrictive CORS origins; never allow wildcard origins (`*`) in production.
- Sanitize error responses: log detailed stack traces internally, but return generic error messages to the client.

## Stage 2: Interactive Project Discovery

Before designing extended architecture, analyze `00-project-idea.md` to answer these 6 discovery questions:

1. **User Access:** Does the application have multiple roles or tiers (e.g., Admin, User)?
2. **File Storage:** Does the system accept file or media uploads from users?
3. **Traffic & Exposure:** Is the platform exposed to public internet traffic with expected high volume?
4. **Transactions & Integrity:** Does the system handle financial transactions or inventory?
5. **External Integrations:** Does the system consume critical third-party APIs?
6. **Compliance & Audit:** Is there a regulatory need to track sensitive actions?

## Stage 3: Dynamic Rule Module Routing (The 6 Modules)

Map the discovery responses directly to the following modular implementations. If triggered, you MUST apply their rules to the tasks:

- **Module 01: Granular Access Control (If Q1 = YES):** Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Prevent Broken Object-Level Authorization (IDOR). Apply a default-deny policy across all routes.
- **Module 02: Secure File Processing (If Q2 = YES):** Validate file types via magic bytes/MIME inspection. Enforce strict file size boundaries. Never store uploaded user files directly on the application server (Use S3, Cloudinary, or Supabase Storage). Re-encode file names.
- **Module 03: Scalability & Abuse Prevention (If Q3 = YES):** Enforce Rate Limiting and throttling at the API level. Implement connection pooling. Offload heavy computations to Background Jobs/Message Queues.
- **Module 04: Transactional Consistency (If Q4 = YES):** Require an `Idempotency-Key` on critical mutations to prevent double-charging. Wrap all multi-step state mutations inside database ACID transactions (or use Saga Pattern).
- **Module 05: Resilient Integrations (If Q5 = YES):** Wrap outbound calls to external dependencies with a Circuit Breaker. Implement retry strategies utilizing exponential backoff. Enforce explicit connection timeouts.
- **Module 06: Comprehensive Auditing (If Q6 = YES):** Record immutable audit trails for high-risk operations (authentication, role changes, financial data). Filter and mask sensitive data in logs.
